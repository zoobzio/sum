# Overview

Sum is an application framework for Go that wires together HTTP, data stores, configuration, and services into a unified lifecycle. Register components once, retrieve them anywhere by type.

## The Idea

Building a Go service means assembling pieces: an HTTP server, database connections, configuration loading, service dependencies, event handling. Each piece has its own initialization, its own lifecycle, its own way of being passed around.

Sum asks: what if these pieces shared a common registry and lifecycle?

Register a service implementation against its contract type. Later, anywhere in your application, retrieve it by that same type. No string keys, no global variables, no dependency injection frameworks. Just types.

## The Implementation

Sum provides:

- **Service Registry** — Type-safe service locator with `Register[T]` and `Use[T]`
- **Lifecycle Management** — Singleton `Service` with startup, signal handling, and graceful shutdown
- **Configuration Loading** — Load config via fig and register it as a retrievable service
- **Typed Events** — Define `Event[T]` once, emit and listen with full type safety
- **Data Store Helpers** — Wire databases, KV stores, and object buckets to the registry and data catalog

## What It Enables

Sum is the glue layer for the zoobzio ecosystem:

| Need | Package | Sum Integration |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| HTTP endpoints | [rocco](https://github.com/zoobzio/rocco) | `Service.Handle()` registers endpoints |
| Database access | [grub](https://github.com/zoobzio/grub) | `Database()` wires to registry + catalog |
| Configuration | [fig](https://github.com/zoobzio/fig) | `Config()` loads and registers |
| Events | [capitan](https://github.com/zoobzio/capitan) | `Event[T]` provides typed wrapper |
| Observability | [scio](https://github.com/zoobzio/scio) | Data catalog auto-populated |

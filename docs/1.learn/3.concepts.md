# Concepts

Sum has four core abstractions: the Service, the Registry, Events, and Data Helpers. Understanding these mental models makes the API intuitive.

## Service

The `Service` is a singleton that owns the application lifecycle.

**What it represents:** Your running application—the HTTP server, data catalog, and configuration bundled together.

**Why it exists:** Go applications need coordinated startup and shutdown. The Service provides a single point of control: `New()` creates it, `Run()` starts it and blocks until shutdown, `Shutdown()` stops it gracefully.

**How to think about it:** The Service is the root. Everything else—endpoints, data stores, configuration—attaches to it. There is exactly one per process.

```go
svc := sum.New(sum.ServiceConfig{Host: "localhost", Port: 8080})
svc.Handle(endpoints...)
svc.Run() // blocks until SIGINT/SIGTERM
```

See [Service](../4.reference/2.types.md#service) in the Types Reference.

## Registry

The Registry is a type-safe service locator.

**What it represents:** A map from contract types to implementations, with compile-time type safety.

**Why it exists:** Services need to find each other. String-based lookups are error-prone. Dependency injection frameworks are heavyweight. The Registry uses Go generics: register `*userRepoImpl` as `UserRepository`, retrieve it later by asking for `UserRepository`.

**How to think about it:** The Registry is a phone book indexed by type. Registration happens at startup, lookup happens at runtime. The `Key` controls write access; anyone can read.

```go
// Startup: populate the registry
k := sum.Start()
sum.Register[UserRepository](k, &userRepoImpl{})
sum.Freeze(k)

// Runtime: lookup by type
repo := sum.MustUse[UserRepository](ctx)
```

**Guards:** Registration returns a `Handle` for attaching guards—functions that run on every `Use()` call and can deny access based on context.

```go
sum.Register[AdminService](k, &adminImpl{}).
    Guard(requireRole("admin"))
```

See [Registry Functions](../4.reference/1.api.md#registry) in the API Reference.

## Events

Events provide typed, bidirectional signaling.

**What it represents:** A named signal with a typed payload. Emit from one place, listen from many.

**Why it exists:** Applications need to communicate across boundaries without tight coupling. The `Event[T]` wrapper provides type safety over the underlying capitan signal system.

**How to think about it:** An Event is a radio channel. `Emit()` broadcasts, `Listen()` tunes in. The type parameter `T` ensures emitters and listeners agree on the payload shape.

```go
var OrderPlaced = sum.NewInfoEvent[Order](capitan.Signal("order.placed"))

// Publisher
OrderPlaced.Emit(ctx, order)

// Subscriber
OrderPlaced.Listen(func(ctx context.Context, o Order) {
    // handle order
})
```

**Severity levels:** Events can emit at Debug, Info, Warn, or Error levels, integrating with structured logging.

See [Event](../4.reference/2.types.md#event) in the Types Reference.

## Data Helpers

Data helpers wire persistence to the registry and catalog.

**What they represent:** Convenience functions that create a data store, wrap it in your repository implementation, register it as a service, and add it to the data catalog—all in one call.

**Why they exist:** The pattern is always the same: create store, wrap it, register it, catalog it. The helpers eliminate boilerplate and ensure consistency.

**How to think about it:** Data helpers are factory functions with side effects. They create, wrap, register, and catalog. The factory function you provide turns the raw store into your domain-specific interface.

```go
sum.Database[UserRepo, User](k, db, "users", "id", renderer,
    func(gdb *grub.Database[User]) UserRepo {
        return &userRepoImpl{gdb}
    },
)
```

Three variants exist:
- `Database` — SQL databases via grub.Database
- `Store` — Key-value stores via grub.Store
- `Bucket` — Object storage via grub.Bucket

See [Data Functions](../4.reference/1.api.md#data) in the API Reference.
